# 🤖 Autonomous Research Agent Guide

## Overview

The **Autonomous Research Agent** is a 24/7 self-improving system that continuously:
- Discovers new trading strategies from the web
- Optimizes strategy parameters
- Tests strategies on new assets
- Learns from results and adapts
- Makes decisions on what to improve next

**No human intervention required!**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Brain: ResearchAgent

The main agent orchestrates everything:

```python
from src.research_agent import ResearchAgent

agent = ResearchAgent()

# Run one cycle
results = agent.run_cycle()

# Run forever (24/7)
agent.run_forever(interval_seconds=3600)  # Every hour
```

### Decision-Making Process

Each cycle, the agent:

1. **📊 Evaluates Current State**
   - How many strategies do we have?
   - What's our best Sharpe ratio?
   - How many tests have we run?
   - Are we meeting our goals?

2. **🧠 Decides Next Actions**
   - Need more strategies? → Search the web
   - Performance too low? → Optimize parameters
   - Not enough data? → Test on new assets
   - Always: Continue learning

3. **⚡ Executes Actions**
   - Discovery: Search web, scrape content, create strategies
   - Optimization: Find best parameters for each strategy
   - Testing: Run backtests on untested assets
   
4. **💡 Generates Insights**
   - "New best Sharpe ratio found: 2.15!"
   - "Strategy X works best on crypto assets"
   - "Need more optimization on mean-reversion strategies"

5. **📈 Learns and Adapts**
   - Updates knowledge base
   - Adjusts priorities
   - Plans next cycle

## 🎯 Agent Goals

The agent is programmed with specific targets:

```python
goals = {
    'target_strategies': 50,      # Aim for 50+ strategies
    'target_assets': 30,          # Test across 30+ assets
    'target_sharpe': 2.0,         # Find strategies with Sharpe > 2.0
    'min_tests_per_strategy': 5,  # Test each strategy on 5+ assets
}
```

Progress is tracked automatically and influences decision-making.

## 📦 Components

### 1. Knowledge Base (`knowledge_base.py`)

Tracks what the platform knows:

```python
from src.research_agent import KnowledgeBase

kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Get top performers
best_strategies = kb.get_best_strategies(limit=10)
best_assets = kb.get_best_assets(limit=10)

# Find what needs work
actions = kb.get_next_actions()

# Get overall summary
summary = kb.get_performance_summary()
```

**Key Methods:**
- `get_best_strategies()` - Top performing strategies
- `get_best_assets()` - Assets with best results
- `get_untested_combinations()` - New things to try
- `needs_optimization()` - Check if strategy needs tuning
- `get_next_actions()` - Recommend what to do next

### 2. Strategy Discoverer (`strategy_discoverer.py`)

Finds new strategies automatically:

```python
from src.research_agent import StrategyDiscoverer

discoverer = StrategyDiscoverer()

# Search the web
results = discoverer.search_for_strategies(max_results=20)

# Process scraped content
new_strategies = discoverer.process_scraped_content()

# Run full cycle
discovery_results = discoverer.run_discovery_cycle()
```

**What It Does:**
- Searches web for trading strategies
- Analyzes content for strategy patterns (RSI, MA, momentum, etc.)
- Extracts parameters from articles
- Creates new strategy entries in database
- Suggests new indicators to try
- Recommends new asset classes

### 3. Improvement Engine (`improvement_engine.py`)

Continuously optimizes and tests:

```python
from src.research_agent import ImprovementEngine

engine = ImprovementEngine()

# Optimize a strategy
result = engine.optimize_strategy(strategy_id=1, asset='AAPL')

# Test on new asset
result = engine.test_on_new_asset(strategy_id=1, asset='BTC-USD')

# Run full improvement cycle
improvement_results = engine.run_improvement_cycle()
```

**What It Does:**
- Optimizes strategy parameters (grid search)
- Tests strategies on new assets
- Runs backtests automatically
- Saves results to database
- Identifies improvements

### 4. Main Research Agent (`main_agent.py`)

The orchestrator that ties everything together:

```python
from src.research_agent import ResearchAgent

agent = ResearchAgent()

# Get status
status = agent.get_status_report()

# Run one cycle
results = agent.run_cycle()

# Run continuously
agent.run_forever(3600)  # Every hour
```

**Decision Logic:**
- If < 50% of strategy goal → Focus on discovery
- If best Sharpe < target → Focus on optimization
- If few tests → Expand testing
- Always → Continue learning

---

## 🚀 Running the Agent

### Option 1: Demo (One Cycle)

```bash
python demo_autonomous_agent.py
```

This runs **one complete cycle** and shows:
- Current state evaluation
- Planned actions
- Execution results
- Insights generated
- Updated statistics

### Option 2: Continuous 24/7 Operation

```bash
python -c "from src.research_agent import ResearchAgent; ResearchAgent().run_forever(3600)"
```

Or create a script `run_agent.py`:

```python
from src.research_agent import ResearchAgent

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = ResearchAgent()
    agent.run_forever(interval_seconds=3600)  # Every hour
```

Then run:
```bash
nohup python run_agent.py > agent.log 2>&1 &
```

### Option 3: Custom Intervals

```python
from src.research_agent import ResearchAgent
import time

agent = ResearchAgent()

# Run every 30 minutes
while True:
    agent.run_cycle()
    time.sleep(1800)  # 30 minutes
```

kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Performance summary
summary = kb.get_performance_summary()
print(f"Total strategies: {summary['total_strategies']}")
print(f"Best Sharpe: {summary['max_sharpe']}")

# Top performers
best = kb.get_best_strategies(limit=5)
for strategy in best:
    print(f"{strategy['name']}: Sharpe {strategy['avg_sharpe']}")
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Agent not improving?

Check:
```python
status = agent.get_status_report()
print(status['next_actions'])  # What is it planning?
print(status['current_evaluation'])  # What does it see?
```

### Too slow?

Reduce actions per cycle:
```python
agent.config['max_actions_per_cycle'] = 5
```

### Want faster cycles?

```python
agent.run_forever(interval_seconds=1800)  # Every 30 min
```
